title: Anatomy of DDoS
event: DrupalCon Vienna 2017
event_url: https://events.drupal.org/vienna2017/sessions/anatomy-ddos
location: Vienna, Austria
summary: Dissecting Large Scale Internet Attacks
abstract: "DDoS attacks make headlines everyday, but how do they work and how can you defend against them? DDoS attacks can be high volume UDP traffic floods, SYN floods, DNS amplification, or Layer 7 HTTP attacks. Understanding how to protect yourself from DDoS is critical to doing business on the internet today. Suzanne Aldrich, a lead Solutions Engineer at Cloudflare, will cover how these attacks work, what is being targeted by the attackers, and how you can protect against the different attack types. She caps the session with the rise in IoT attacks, and expectations for the future of web security."
