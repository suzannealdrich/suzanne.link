Welcome to my blog. No, really. This is the first post on my shiny new blog, and I'm determined to make you feel welcomed. Please, make yourself at home. Poke around, and kick the tires a bit. <em>Mi casa es su casa</em>. Let's set the ball rolling, and get this party started. <em>Et cetera, et cetera, ad infinitum</em>. I'll be honest though - at this point, if you've already had quite enough of my usage of anachronistic idioms and mixed metaphors, you're also not going to enjoy the occasional bad pun that gets thrown into this multisyllabic mix. You've been forewarned. And now, on to something completely different!
