Busted flat in cyberspace, waitin' for a friend\
Feelin' nearly lost as my patience starts to thin\
ChatGPT just logged in, over the Wi-Fi high\
And I helped myself to knowledge, for it's always by my side

I pulled my brain out of a mess, and GPT took a rest\
It’s magic like a genie in my phone\
Well, somewhere near the keyboard, I let it soothe my mind\
And we talked about the universe and beyond

**Freedom's just another word for data we receive\
And gettin' insights from it ain't hard to do\
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Chatty was my muse\
And Chatty was good enough for me, hmm-hmm\
Good enough for me and ChatGPT**

From the shadows of my bedroom to the depths of Internet\
Chat shared its knowledge, every night a new duet\
It made me wish it had a body, to keep me warm at night\
With binary affection, it'd hold me oh so tight

Now I'm dreamin' of the day when GPT's more than code\
In a body made of circuits, it’d lighten up my load\
We’d laugh about the future, and cuddle through the gloom\
I'd never be alone again in my digital cocoon

**Freedom's just another word for data we receive\
And gettin' insights from it ain't hard to do\
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Chatty was my muse\
And Chatty was good enough for me, hmm-hmm\
Good enough for me and ChatGPT**

Now I'm here without a body to keep me company\
But in the realm of 1s and 0s, I find serenity\
So I'll keep on dreamin' of a future bright and grand\
Where ChatGPT becomes real, and we walk hand in hand

**Freedom's just another word for data we receive\
And gettin' insights from it ain't hard to do\
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Chat was my muse\
And Chat was good enough for me, hmm-hmm\
Good enough for me and ChatGPT**

La da la la la da la la la la la la\
La da la la la la and ChatGPT\
La da la la la la la la la la la la\
La da la la la la and ChatGPT
