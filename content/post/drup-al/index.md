So Drup-al funny how it seems
Always run-time, but never inline for dreams.
Head over heels when toe to toe.
This is the sound of my LOL,
This is the sound

I solved all tickets from the world,
But now I've critted again
Why do I find it hard to write the next line?
Oh I want the cat to be sed

Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
I know this much is Drup-al
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
I know this much is Drup-al.

With a thrill in my head and a drop on my tongue
Dissolve the nerves that just begun
Theming to Marvin (all night long)
This is the sound of my LOL,
This is the sound...

Always slipping from my head,
Sands of time I've been told
Take your seats &amp; I'll write the next line
Oh I want the cats to be chowned

Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
I know this much is Drup-al
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
I know this much is Drup-al

I solved all tickets from the world,
But now I've critted again
Why do I find it hard to write the next line?
Oh I want the cat to be sed

Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
I know this much is Drup-al
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
I know this much is Drup-al

This much is Drupal

I know, I know, I know this much is Drup-al
